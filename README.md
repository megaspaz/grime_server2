This is an RPG gaming, chat server which the [client](https://github.com/megaspaz/grime_client) runs against.

## Prerequisites

Written in Java, using swing and AWT. Currently, this has been tested against Java 8. The development has been on Eclipse 2019-06, so there maybe some Eclipse-specific under the hood things going on.
